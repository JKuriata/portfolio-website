<h1 id="title">Coding</h1>
<p> My coding journey started perhaps two months ago when a friend of mine who is a programmer decided to teach me some simple python. From then I was hooked. After years of studying the humanities it was beautiful for there to just be a correct answer.</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>works and good_practice</p>
<p>print("Is correct!! :D")</p>
<p>After years of arguing about curtains being blue symbolising misery or royalty, it was a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>My friend reccomended Swift Playground to me and I was working my way through the basics when I came across an advert for Code Nation's 3 week crashcourse. I signed up on the Thursday and by Monday I had started the course; Going from gaming and sleeping all day to working 9:30 - 17:30. Week one was difficult in terms of adjusting but each day I found myself excited enough to learn to keep awake. That was a new experiance, actually wanting to learn over being forced into it. After the first week we were tasked with producing a text based adventure as a team. I took charge of the fighting mechanics.</p>

<p>I also made a mini boss but it is a simplified version of this as I made it easily reusable through refactoring!</p>
