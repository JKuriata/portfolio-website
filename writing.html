<h1 id="title">Writing</h1>
<h3>A brief prefix</h3>
<p>As an ex creative-writing student I have devoloped quite a wide range portfolio of my writing. One of my favourite pieces was from year one where we were given some free reign to write whatever we wanted. I attended a Jack the Ripper tour a little while before...</p>
<h4>Our last date</h4>
<p>Red was always your favourite colour. So I scoured the markets for the right flowers. Roses were cliché of course, you would laugh, call me a romantic. No, I wanted something unexpected, something different, something to take your breath away.</p>
<p>I was shocked when I saw them, lilies in red. White was the most common, of course, but would never suit you. The lady at the stall wrapped them up for me and explained they would open later. I hoped you would too. </p>
<p>We agreed to meet by Ten Bells, I hadn’t visited before but I never did like retracing my steps. The pub was bustling with life, it poured out into the street and beckoned me between the sheets. They were tempting, the painted girls only a few shillings away from becoming mine. Not today, my sweet young harlots, your time is yet to come.</p> 
<p>I reminded myself I was on a date, this was not my usual night. This was different. </p>
<p>You see, I usually prefer something quick, I know it’s not something a gentleman should ever admit. But I think it common for one of my stature to use a lady of the night, get that release and leave without a second thought. So you see you are quite different. I took you out on dates, paid for meals, smiled and laughed and got to know all about your wretched life. In turn you listened to my lies. </p>
<p>We lived in different worlds, you were behind on rent, I had my suits dry cleaned on a weekly basis. You wouldn’t have understood my struggles as I pretended to care for yours. We would understand each other better when the night was through.  </p>
<p>I arrived early, it was important to be punctual. You arrived late, I smiled and said it was perfectly understandable. We headed into the pub and talked over drinks. You told me of a difficult client you had earlier, I agreed men could be difficult. We laughed at the irony of my saying that. I laughed harder than you did.</p>
<p>As I had hoped you invited me back to yours. It was only round the corner and I was ever so tired. We headed back through the dark streets and you held my arm as one would a shield. The city was so full of crime nowadays, I couldn’t blame you. I could pity you. I didn’t. </p>
<p>We arrived at your shamble of a home, the window had been smashed in a few days before, while you were at work. I wondered if you ever found the stone. </p>
<p>You locked the door.</p>
<p>I closed the blinds. </p>
<p>You began to understand. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When my paper came the next morning I flipped through to find you. Did you want fame my dear? You certainly got it. A two page spread on the grand opening of your flowers. Details on the petals of flesh I scattered round your bedroom.</p>
<p>I ripped out the page and ironed it out, it would wrap nicely around the next bouquet.</p>

<h3>Forced Poetry</h3>
<p>While writing stories is my passion, there is no English course that will not force you to write poetry. So here is one of mine based on my abusive relationship with a narcissist...</p>

<h4>Gaslit Dreams</h4>
<article class="poem">
    <p>A beautiful facade<br />
    So confident and bright<br />
    A world on your tongue<br />
    A game full of delight <br />
    </p>
    <p>Plots of intrigue all around<br />
    Orders crisp and ripe like sound<br />
    Make me kneel, make me beg<br />
    Just don’t let me leave this bed <br />
    </p>
    <p>Memories so sweet and hot<br />
    Tell a tale of love I lost<br />
    Confidence, a whip like smile<br />
    Please just let me stay a while. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Wrapped around your little finger<br />
    I know that I cannot linger<br />
    I'm not ready for the fall<br />
    I'm begging please don’t let me go-<br />
    </p>
    <p>I tumble down the path from sleep.<br />
    And wake besides a man.<br />
    He looks just like you, yet I weep.<br />
    What happened to the love I found?<br />
    </p>
